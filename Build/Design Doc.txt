Tumble Pin Lock:


This lockpicking minigame simulates an ordinary 5 pin tumble lock.

-Move the move forward/back to move the lockpicking pick.
-Hold the left mouse button AND move forward/back to raise/lower the pick.
-Use the pick to raise the pins gently into position. (they will turn green when locked in place)

-Space is used to apply pressure with the torsion wrench to the lock.
	-The Bar on the right represents the amount of force applied to the lock.
	-Green is optimal(nothing bad will happen)
	-Too little force and the pins may fall out of position.
	-Too much force and your torsion wrench may break. 

-You have only a limited supply of wrenchs (lives).
-A Timer shows the time remaining near the bottom right.
